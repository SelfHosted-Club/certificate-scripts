# CertWarden Certificate Fetcher/Importer that is somewhat automated
# Grabs certificate and key from CertWarden, converts it to a PKCS12, and imports to the System Personal Certificate Store in Windows.
# Version 2.0

# This script assumes ZERO liability for services that it may affect.
# Please add more error handling if you're using in production.

# Run this in an admin powershell window. It will not add to the correct store/fail if you don't.
#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
